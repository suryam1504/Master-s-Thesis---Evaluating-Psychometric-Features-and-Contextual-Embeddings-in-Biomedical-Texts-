# Master's Thesis - Evaluating Psychometric Features and Contextual Embeddings Potential for Mental Disorder Classification in Short Biomedical Texts 

This is my Master's Thesis, conducted in the final semester at the Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology, Surat, India, under the supervision of Dr. Sandra Mitrovic (IDSIA - USI/SUPSI, Switzerland) and Dr. Amit Sharma (Department of Mathematics, SVNIT, India).

The study involves extracting psychological features such as emotions, emotional intensity, Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) metrics, and contextual embeddings from short biomedical texts using state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and advanced transformer models. This is followed by developing predictive models with XGBoost and multi-layer deep learning architectures to classify texts as either of anxiety, panic, and depression, with an F1-score of 0.894. Lastly, I also explored and employed Large Language Models (LLMs) like Mistral and META LLAMA for Causal Inferencing.
